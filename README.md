## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** JavaScript

I solve at least one coding challenge on CodeWars a day!

## Optimizations

I refactor and optimize my code consistently for efficiency and for readability.

## Lessons Learned:

There is a lot that I can learn! There are many ways to solve a problem and do it efficiently. Even if I can't answer a question, I learned that as long as you take the initiative to improve and learn from others and how they solve problems, I will learn!
